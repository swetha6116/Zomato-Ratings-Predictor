# Restaurant Rating Prediction

With the increasing availability of restaurant reviews and ratings data, predicting restaurant ratings has become an interesting task in the restaurant industry. In this project, we present a comparative study of machine learning models for predicting restaurant ratings based on various user and restaurant features.

## Objective

The main objective of this project is to evaluate several popular machine learning techniques for predicting restaurant ratings using a dataset of Yelp reviews and ratings. We aim to compare the performance of different models and gain insights into the impact of various user and restaurant features on rating prediction accuracy.

## Dataset

We utilize a dataset of Yelp reviews and ratings for this study. The dataset includes a wide range of features, including user information and restaurant attributes. This comprehensive dataset allows us to explore the relationship between these features and restaurant ratings.

## Methodology

**Data Preprocessing:** We perform necessary data cleaning and preprocessing steps to ensure the dataset is suitable for analysis. This includes handling missing values, data normalization, and feature engineering.

**Model Selection:** We compare several machine learning models for rating prediction, including linear regression, decision tree, random forest, and gradient boosting. These models are chosen for their popularity and ability to handle regression tasks.

**Model Training and Evaluation:** We split the dataset into training and testing sets. The models are trained on the training set and evaluated on the testing set using appropriate evaluation metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) or root mean squared error (RMSE).

**Feature Importance Analysis:** In addition to model performance evaluation, we conduct feature importance analysis to understand the impact of different features on the accuracy of rating predictions. This analysis provides insights into the key factors that influence restaurant ratings.

## Results and Discussion

We present the results of our comparative study, including the performance of each machine learning model and the associated evaluation metrics. Additionally, we discuss the findings from the feature importance analysis and highlight the significant features that contribute to accurate rating predictions.
